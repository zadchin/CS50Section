## Section Practice Problems

### Section Problem 1

**Background**

You are tasked with implementing a background task within the Flask application that records each login attempt. This record should include the username, and the result of the attempt (success or failure). For simplicity, these records can be stored in a simple text file or a more sophisticated solution like a database, depending on the student's level of experience.

**Task**

1. Within ```login``` function in ```app.py``` of your HTML, construct a form that includes:

- (Done) Check if the user has login, yes - return template welcome.html
- If method == POST
  - get username and password
  - if match, redirect to ```welcome.html```
  - else ```flash('Invalid username or password')```
- else (If method == GET)
  - redirect to ```login.html```


**Demo**

## Starter Code

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

## Solution 

```
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    # Check if the user is already logged in
    if 'username' in session:
        return render_template('welcome.html')

    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        if username == correct_username and password == correct_password:
            session['username'] = username  # Set username in the session
            return  render_template('welcome.html')
        else:
            flash('Invalid username or password')  # Flash a message to the next page
            
    # Show the login form
    return render_template('login.html')
```
