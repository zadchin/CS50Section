They consist of nodes, where each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. Understanding pointers is crucial for managing linked lists, as they are used to navigate and modify the list structure.\nTask\nCreate a function that reverses a singly linked list. The list is represented by a struct named node, which contains an integer number and a pointer to the next node. Your task is to write a function void reverse(node **head) that takes a pointer to the head of the list and reverses the order of the nodes. The challenge is to manipulate the pointers in each node to reverse the order without creating any new nodes or losing any existing ones.\nDemo\nDemo in Section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarter Code\n\n\n\nCopy the code at here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips & Pseudocode\n\n\n\n\n\nExample in Words\nImagine a simple linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null\n\nStart: prev = null, current = 1, next = null\nFirst Iteration:\n\nnext points to 2 (saving link to next node)\nReverse link: 1 <- current, but next (2) -> 3\nMove prev to 1, current to 2 (advance pointers)\nNow: null <- 1 <- current (2) -> 3\n\nSecond Iteration:\n\nnext points to 3\nReverse link: 2 <- current, but next (3) -> null\nMove prev to 2, current to 3\nNow: null <- 1 <- 2 <- current (3)\n\nFinal Iteration:\n\nnext is null (end of list)\nReverse link: 3 -> null\ncurrent becomes null, loop ends\nFinal list: null <- 1 <- 2 <- 3\n\n\nThe head of the list now points to 3, achieving the reversed list: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null\nPseudocode\n1. Initialize three pointers: prev (null), current (head of the list), and next (null).\n\n2. Loop while current is not null:\n - Set next to current->next (save the next node).\n - Redirect current->next to prev (reverse the link).\n - Move prev to current (advance prev up the list).\n - Move current to next (advance current up the list).\n \n3. After the loop, set the head of the list to prev.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nvoid reverse(node **head) {\n    node *prev = NULL;\n    node *current = *head;\n    node *next = NULL;\n\n    while (current != NULL) {\n        next = current->next;\n        current->next = prev;\n        prev = current;\n        current = next;\n    }\n    *head = prev;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Problem 2\nBackground\nHash tables are powerful data structures that allow for efficient data retrieval. They map keys to values, using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. This exercise focuses on understanding how to search for items in a hash table, an essential operation known as a lookup.\nTask\nWrite a function, bool lookup(char* word, node* hashtable[], int size), that searches for a given word in a hash table. The hash table is represented as an array of linked lists (node* hashtable[]), and size is the number of buckets in the table. The function should return true if the word is found and false otherwise.\nDemo\nWill be shown in section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarter Code\n\n\n\nCopy the code at here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudocode\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Hash the Word using the provided hash function: Use the hash function on the input word to determine the index in the hashtable.\n\n2. Traverse the Linked List: At the calculated index, traverse the linked list attached to that bucket.\n   - If the current node's word matches the input word, return True.\n   - If not, move to the next node in the list.\n\n3. Word Not Found: If the end of the list is reached without finding the word, return False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1:\nbool lookup(const char* word, node* hashtable[]) {\n    unsigned int index = hash(word);\n    node *cursor = hashtable[index];\n    while (cursor != NULL) {\n        if (strcmp(cursor->word, word) == 0) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        cursor = cursor->next;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\nSolution 2\nbool lookup(const char* word, node* hashtable[]) {\n    unsigned int index = hash(word);\n\n    // Use a for loop to traverse the linked list\n    for (node *cursor = hashtable[index]; cursor != NULL; cursor = cursor->next) {\n        if (strcmp(cursor->word, word) == 0) {\n            return true; // Word found\n        }\n    }\n    return false; // Word not found\n}"
